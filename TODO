* Consider setting concurrent_insert to 2 on MySQL to make sure we don't
have nasty locking scenarios when there are holes in the middle
of the trigrams table. See:

http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.0/en/server-system-variables.html#sysvar_concurrent_insert

Or, as an alternate way of doing defragmentation that doesn't block the server
for ages like OPTIMIZE, perhaps can just rebuild trigrams for the most-recently
inserted trigram rows until fragmentation no longer in place? In concurrent_insert
mode 1, this should cause it to reallocate those trigram rows backwards into the hole.

* Alternate strategy: stick rec_id in the index too, so that selects never
have to leave the index at all.
